Choose which platform to implement our design, opendaylight or onos?

According to some reasons bellow, we decide to use onos:

1.The code of onos is cleaner than opendaylight;
2.Huawei is the sponsor of onos;
3.The distributed architecture with clear specification of onos will be more suitable for our design.

Tasks:

1.How to implement in onos?
2.Make slides to analyze the computation of f_local and f_aggregation.
3.Is there a better method to reduce the workload of f_local? (currently, we use T_aggregation)
4.How to split T_i?
